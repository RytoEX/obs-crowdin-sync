**crowdin-synchronization** is a collection of 2 GitHub Actions that streamline the synchronization and localization process between the [OBS Studio repository](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) and the [OBS Studio Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/obs-studio).

The directories `download` and `upload` contain a separate `README.md` with more explanation. The directory `shared` contains shared code used by both actions.
